              The Brothers of Christ of Banneux, Inc. is a religious
              congregation founded by the Servant of God Msgr. Aloysius
              Schwartz, an American missionary priest in Seoul, Korea on May 10,
              1981, to respond to the reality of poverty, suffering and
              deprivation of the poorest of the poor. The congregation
              supervises and maintains a program that provides shelter and
              training to the destitute and homeless elderly people and young
              adult. They render various forms of assistance and service that
              include direct evangelization and value formation, as well as
              livelihood trainings, self-help projects, recreational facilities
              and retreat activities. In Seoul, Korea the Brothers are taking
              care of 1,700 abandoned adults and elderly men who are physically
              and mentally challenged, homeless and alcoholic. The Brothers take
              proper care for those entrusted to their care by providing them
              free hospice, food, clothing, medical and health services. To
              broaden their knowledge in the welfare and services, and to be
              able to provide quality services the Brothers visited other
              welfare institutions for the homeless people located in the major
              cities in Korea and while others attended social welfare classes
              to obtain a social worker license. In the Philippines, seeing the
              Filipinos urgent need to alleviate the sufferings of the poor
              people, they decided to set up, supervise, operate and maintain a
              welfare program for the poorest of poor, elderly and young adult,
              the OSY, physically and mentally challenged men by providing them
              with various forms of voluntary assistance. To wit: Evangelization
              and value formation, livelihood programs, self-help projects and
              recreational clientele coming from different places of the
              country. In almost two years of preparation for the operation of
              the residential care for the Out of School Youth, physically and
              mentally challenged men, they become busy visiting different kind
              of institutions to gather some information and see the actual
              operation for the said clients. Seeing the needs of the society
              for the physically and mentally challenged men and the Out of
              School Youth, Brother Matthew Gu, together with the Filipino
              Brothers, established the Brothers of Christ of Banneux, Inc.
              (BCBI) in the Philippines in order to serve these underprivileged
              people. The institution is a non-stock, no-profit corporation that
              provides residential care for the poorest of the poor. It will be
              maintained and supported by grants, donations, gifts and bequest
              from noble, selfless and well-meaning persons and entities locally
              and internationally.
